      Nandhi Kanti Vinay Kumar (Front-End Developer)
    </h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>Vinay Nandhikanti.</strong> I'm an International Masters CS student from India for the Spring 2023 semester. I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. </p>

    <p>
      I did two academic projects during my Undergrad, the significant one is my Deep Learning project which is "Perclos based Real-time Drowsiness detection system depending on Eye-Aspect Ratio. This model determines drivers fatigue factor when he feels drowsy and can help in preventing road accidents".
      <p>And the other is Machine Learning Project called "Resume Screening System" which uses KNN classifiers for shortlisting resumes. I completed these projects under the super vision of my professors with a team of 3.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel very excited for the CSC 848 class and to work as teams.
