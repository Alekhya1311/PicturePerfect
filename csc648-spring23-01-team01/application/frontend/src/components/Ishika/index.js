               <p>

                   I am a skilled computer science professional with experience in software development, technical leadership, and project management. I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Nirma Institute of Technology and am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science from San Francisco State University.

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have developed a strong set of technical skills in various programming languages, web development tools, databases, and cloud services. I have experience working with Python, R, Java, C, HTML, CSS, PHP, Django, Flask, Git, Azure DevOps, and BitBucket, among other technologies.

<ul>I have also developed a solid foundation in databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and cloud services such as AWS and Google Cloud. I have experience using JIRA, Apache Spark, and agile tools to support project management and data analysis.

In addition to my technical skills, I have experience with statistical analysis, data mining, machine learning, and deep learning using tools like Keras and TensorFlow. My experience in these areas includes developing tools and applications for various personal projects, such as a yoga pose estimation system and a mood-based music player.

My technical abilities are further demonstrated by my professional experience, including my roles as a Business Technology Solutions Associate and Technical Lead at ZS Associates, where I worked as a backend developer on custom applications and managed various projects and project teams. I also worked as a Python Development Intern at CppSecrets Technologies Pvt. Ltd., where I developed data structures and algorithms in Python and automated tools to support software development.
